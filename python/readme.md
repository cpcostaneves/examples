# Python Examples

Base Python 3.6

## Language


Scripting language, Interpreted. Can be compiled to byte-code.

Supports interactive mode 

Supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.

Case sensitive

Types:
- dynamically typed language: variable name is bound only to an object not a type (unless it is null).
- strongly typed language: explicit conversion is required (eg. from int to string).
- supports dynamic type checking.

Blocks of code:
- Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation
- A group of statements in a single code block are called suites. 
- Compound or complex statements, such as if, while, def, and class require a header line and a suite.
- Header lines begin the statement and terminate with a colon ( : ), followed by suite.

Supports automatic garbage collection.

Semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on the single line

Comment: '#' or ''' for multiline 

Reserved Words


## Naming conventions

Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.
Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.
Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier.
If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.

## Coding Style

PEP 8 style guide
- Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.
- Wrap lines so that they donâ€™t exceed 79 characters.
- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.
- When possible, put comments on a line of their own.
- Use docstrings.
- Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4).
- Convention is to use UpperCamelCase for classes and lowercase_with_underscores for functions and methods. 
- Always use self as the name for the first method argument.


## Modes

Modes
- Interactive Mode Programming
- Script Mode Programming


## Running a script

Python 3; easy_install and Pip; virtualenv

Install python3
- Linux Yum based
```
$ sudo yum -y install python3
```
- Apt get based:
```
$ sudo apt -y install python3
```

Install pip (package-management system)
```
$ sudo python3 -m easy_install pip
```

Install virtualenv
```
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
```


## Running a script

Run
```
python file.py
```

Or as shell script. Include first line of file
```
#!/usr/bin/env python
```

Change permission
```
chmod +x file.py
```

And run
```
./file.py
```

Use Ctl-D to stop execution

If more than one Python version installed, use 'python3' command


## Examples

Common Examples in examples.py

Run
```
python3 examples.py
```

Run in virtualenv
```
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python3 examples.py
```

To Leave virtualenv: 
```
$ deactivate
```

virtualenv: virtual environment (separates resources from current operating system).
